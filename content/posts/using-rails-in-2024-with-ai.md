## Introduction
First of all, some background. I used to write Rails professionally about 7 years ago, but havenâ€™t touched it since. So by 2024, I'd forgotten most of what I've once known. That means that when I decided to build my new project, a community for digital nomads called [nomadgrep](https://www.nomadgrep.com), I felt honestly a bit intimated.

What I wanted to build wasn't that complicated; a forum and a wiki with some community features. At least to start with, for an MVP.

I can't deny that the inspiration had come from NomadList, a product that I used and loved, but felt frustrated with for it's lack of community features; what I felt was a focus on the wrong kind of features and general abandonment of the product by its owner. When NomadList shut down its Slack server in favour of, what I felt, was a very strange decision to use Telegram instead, I decided that I'd had enough. I wanted to scratch my own itch and release my own take on what a social platform for digital nomads should look like.
